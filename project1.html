		        <p>The past several decades have shown a booming industry in the world of tattoo artistry, generating an estimated 50 billion dollars per year. Almost every city, from small town to large metropolis has a culture that supports the independent tattoo shop. Along with the popularity of the medium, comes the competition to establish and maintain a loyal customer base. While talent often speaks for itself and word-of-mouth has been a legacy business driver, the modern tattoo artist must also be well-represented online. The Bad Panda Tattoo project demonstrates a site that benefits the independent shop that needs to not only market its artists to the community, but also help educate its customers.</p>

		        <h3 class="section-title">Requirements</h3>
		        <p>The Bad Panda Tattoo project presents a responsive user interface for the following areas: </p>
		        
		        <ul class="mb-5 ms-md-5">
				  <li class="mb-3"><strong>Main page:</strong> Introduction the business with navigation, key strengths of the business with visual representation of the work and the facility.</li>
                  <li class="mb-3"><strong>Artist page:</strong> Photo and profile of each artist along with a link to a gallery for each artist.</li>
				  <li class="mb-3"><strong>Matcher page:</strong> A form-driven questionnaire to learn more about the client and match them with an ideal artist.</li>
				  <li class="mb-3"><strong>Gallery page:</strong> Presents two types of galleries: A style gallery that helps define tattoo types (inspiration for customers) and Artist galleries to show work created by particular artists.</li>
                  <li class="mb-3"><strong>Shopping page:</strong> A display template for merchandise to be sold.</li>
                  <li class="mb-3"><strong>News:</strong> A page that shows blog-type posts, store promotions and published reviews of the tattoo shop.</li>
                  <li class="mb-3"><strong>FAQ:</strong> Frequently asked questions about getting a tattoo.</li>
                  <li class="mb-3"><strong>Contact:</strong> A page that formats a message to the business while also providing a map of the location.</li>
				</ul>
				
                <p>The core design was that all of the page views should be unified by matching header and footer branding and
                    navigation. This was the starting point for converting the design from wireframe into code. The wireframes provided
                    basic layout of graphics, text and form details, but I spent some time choosing:</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Color:</strong> Tattoo culture dictates the use of black background that allows the images to pop. I chose
                    thematic colors as follows:
                    <ul class="mb-2 ms-md-3">
                        <li class="mb-1">Black as the body background</li>
                        <li class="mb-1">Gray backgrounds for containers that display grouped items (forms, gallery, shopping) </li>
                        <li class="mb-1">Denim blue for headers and cards</li>
                        <li class="mb-1">Red for action buttons</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Header:</strong> To optimize the header for all viewports, I took the approach of
                    separating the nav-bar into its own row and making it sticky-top with denim color. The nav-bar also collapses to a
                    button on XS viewports. When it collapses for these viewports, I also remove less-important text areas while preserving the core branding and authentication links. I also have the collapsed menu "auto-close" after a selection is made, to maximize the screen view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Footer:</strong> I looked for a modern, yet simple footer design. I found inspiration in a thick sparse
                    “unstyled” list approach that provides redundant navigation links, shop contact information and a logo/social media
                    section. The footer was designed to be black and float as a less-emphasized area below a final separator line on
                    every page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Artist Page:</strong> This was one of the most simply executed pages as reacstrap handled the display of
                    zig-zag responsive columns of text and photos. Not many challenges were encountered in developing this essential
                    page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Matcher page:</strong> The matcher page was an exercise in following precise formatting using reactstrap
                    (eventually replaced by react-redux-form) classes. The most difficulty was in finding the balance of padding needed
                    to keep radio buttons and their labels spaced out evenly. When the form is submitted, Redux handles the asynchronous request and uses fetch to post to the Express server backend. A result page/modal displays the response information that is returned from the /match endpoint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Galleries:</strong> The gallery page was straightforward to implement as rows and columns of images that
                    were clickable, but I opted for lightbox2 libraries to provide “animated” large-image pop-up viewing. This
                    integration was very easy to implement using sample code. However, I didn’t want to create a separate html page for
                    each gallery, so I developed a tabbed interface that contained each panel of 12 lightbox images. I used this
                    template for both style galleries (each tab is a tattoo style) and for artist galleries (each tab is an artist’s
                    name). I modified the site navigation (nav-bar) so that Gallery is a drop-down between the two gallery types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Shopping:</strong> The shopping page shows a modern image viewer that toggles between two images when
                    hovered (a way to show the front and back of an item). The UI also makes use of font-awesome stars for reviews. The
                    page is incomplete in function at the current time since there are major server-side dependencies for selecting
                    available sizes, completing the order tunnel for shipping and payment, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>News:</strong> The news page is ambitious in the amount of information that it intends to display. The multi-column format is straightforward bootstrap responsive design, but the columns may (and will) have very different content lengths. This is especially true of the news blog section that may scroll longest. The promotions section is a small fixed area in comparison.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>FAQ:</strong> The FAQ page uses a vertical fade-in animated viewer. It was implemented this way instead of using static text, just to give the page a little more liveliness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Contact:</strong> The contact page uses react-redux form for collecting user name, email, canned reasons and a
                    free text message area. After after hitting the “Send message” button, an asynchronous POST is made to the backend
                    server to record the message.The page also has a display area that uses the Google map as a remote item embedded in an iframe. This integration was
                    relatively straightforward, but image sizing and placement required a lot of trial and error to find the right balance
                    for viewports.
                </p>

				<h3 class="section-title">Actions &amp; Outcomes</h3>
	            <p>React enabled great opportunities to focus the code base from its initial implementation in Bootstrap/jQuery in 9 individual HTML pages. By separating the data out onto the backend server and managing it in the Redux store, the code became reusable. In particular, the code for artist and style galleries became one... only with different data mapping. The transition to React was also enabled by the availabilty of other libraries like: Lightbox and Slick Carousel.<br><br>

                The NodeJS/Express/MongoDB backend server enabled a clean separation of the front-end logic from the programmatic data. Virtually all data is stored as collections/documents in the NoSQL MongoDB along with image files. This enables easy changes to the system without interrupting or redeploying the front-end React application. For example, additional news posts and promotions can be deployed directly to the backend on the appropriate POST/PUT endpoints. An even more powerful use case is when an artist leaves the shop: dropping their artist document will make their profile and corresponding artist gallery vanish from the site. Adding a new artist to the team is also straightforward for the backend Express server.

                            I am recommending Patrick Lippert for the position of web developer. Patrick was my student in Nucamp and he was routinely throughout that time the most creative and capable web developer I had in my class. He had a fantastic eye for unique designs, and was able to implement some of the best strategies in my class.
                            Patrick developed UI design and development, and web page design and development in a very short time. He played a significant role, often, in helping other students, and dealt with the details along with the bigger picture. His coding was excellent and his designs were unique and innovative, so I was always happy with his projects."</p>

		        <h3 class="section-title">Conclusions</h3>
                <p>The most intriguing feature of the project is the Artist Matcher. The server-side code that creates a compatibility
                    profile between customer and artist was a fun challenge. As a client-side challenge, the tabbed galleries may be the
                    best feature of the project. The pages push out a bunch of splashy, colorful images that are at the core of the
                    business. The conversion from regular Bootstrap to React was particularly powerful. I was able to reduce the gallery
                    component code from over 1,200 lines to about 250 by using React with mapping methods and data separated out.<br><br>

                    To streamline the project further, I would like to develop a manager interface to upload and publish artist
                    information. Similarly, the news blog and shopping page should have an admin application (the authorization
                    mechanisms and backend endpoints are already there). I would also like to provide an artist login area where they
                    can answer the individual score questions directly with a form.
